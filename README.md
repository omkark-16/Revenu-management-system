# Revenue Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Revenue Management System** is a full-stack web application developed using **React** for the frontend and **Spring Boot (Java)** for the backend. The project is designed to manage, track, and analyze revenue-related data in an organized and efficient manner.

The frontend is built using a **component-based architecture** in React, along with **routing** to navigate between different pages of the application. The backend is developed using **Java** with the **Spring Boot framework**, which handles business logic, APIs, and data processing.
